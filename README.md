# scholarly
This is the fork of [scholarly](https://github.com/OrganicIrradiation/scholarly) which is a module that allows you to retrieve author and publication information from [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com) in a friendly, Pythonic way. In this fork, the bibtex entries are also retrieved along with other information in the Publication object.


## Usage
Because `scholarly` does not use an official API, no key is required. Simply:

```python
import scholarly

print(next(scholarly.search_author('Steven A. Cholewiak')))
```

### Methods
* `search_author` -- Search for an author by name and return a generator of Author objects.

```python
    >>> search_query = scholarly.search_author('Marty Banks, Berkeley')
    >>> print(next(search_query))
    {'_filled': False,
     'affiliation': 'Professor of Vision Science, UC Berkeley',
     'citedby': 17758,
     'email': '@berkeley.edu',
     'id': 'Smr99uEAAAAJ',
     'interests': ['vision science', 'psychology', 'human factors', 'neuroscience'],
     'name': 'Martin Banks',
     'url_picture': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=Smr99uEAAAAJ'}
```

* `search_keyword` -- Search by keyword and return a generator of Author objects.

```python
    >>> search_query = scholarly.search_keyword('Haptics')
    >>> print(next(search_query))
    {'_filled': False,
     'affiliation': 'Stanford University',
     'citedby': 31731,
     'email': '@cs.stanford.edu',
     'id': '4arkOLcAAAAJ',
     'interests': ['Robotics', 'Haptics', 'Human Motion Understanding'],
     'name': 'Oussama Khatib',
     'url_picture': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=4arkOLcAAAAJ'}
```

* `search_pubs_query` -- Search for articles/publications and return generator of Publication objects. The bibref attribute contains the Bibtex entry for the particular publication.

```python
    >>> search_query = scholarly.search_pubs_query('Perception of physical stability and center of mass of 3D objects')
    >>> print(next(search_query))
    {'_filled': False,
     'bib': {'abstract': 'Humans can judge from vision alone whether an object is '
                         'physically stable or not. Such judgments allow observers '
                         'to predict the physical behavior of objects, and hence '
                         'to guide their motor actions. We investigated the visual '

                         'relates to visual estimates of their center of mass '
                         '(COM). In Experiment 1, observers viewed an object near '
                         'the edge of a table and adjusted its tilt to the '
                         'perceived critical angle, ie, the tilt angle at which '
                         'the object â€¦',

```


### Example
Here's a quick example demonstrating how to retrieve an author's profile then retrieve the titles of the papers that cite his most popular (cited) paper.

```python
    >>> # Retrieve the author's data, fill-in, and print
    >>> search_query = scholarly.search_author('Steven A Cholewiak')
    >>> author = next(search_query).fill()
    >>> print(author)

    >>> # Print the titles of the author's publications
    >>> print([pub.bib['title'] for pub in author.publications])

    >>> # Take a closer look at the first publication
    >>> pub = author.publications[0].fill()
    >>> print(pub)

    >>> # Which papers cited that publication?
    >>> print([citation.bib['title'] for citation in pub.get_citedby()])
```
